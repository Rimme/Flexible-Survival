Trixie	"Trixie"

Trixie is a person. Trixie is in Grey Abbey Library.

The scent of Trixie is "Trixie smells of broken universes and rewritten fate. How anything can smell like that or how you can even know that smell disturbs you to your very core.".

The description of Trixie is "[Trixiedesc]".

to say Trixiedesc:
	say "     Look, it's Trixie, the story fairy! She's about three inches tall, large for her particular breed. She has bright reddish-purple hair and smooth brown skin. Wielded in her right hand is a relatively large wand of old world oak with a great fancy bauble at the end that looks like a cutely renditioned skunk girl head, grinning at you no matter what angle you view it from. Trixie is well shaped, with, relative to the rest of her mass, B cup breasts and wide hips. Her feet are covered in shimmering gold sandals of sorts. Her chest is covered in a t-shirt that reads 'Support us at: https://www.patreon.com/FS'[line break]";
	say "     Trixie's got a button on her t-shirt that says 'Cheaters type [link]iwannacheat[end link]' on it, and a second one that says 'Check out the [link]artwork credits[end link]'. Hmmm.";
	say "     She's also found a ballcap on that says 'Using [link]Export Progress[end link] will save your progress for transfer to a new game version. [link]Import Progress[end link] should restore everything in the new version.' That's a lot to put on a ballcap that small, but for some reason you're able to read it all easily.";

The conversation of Trixie is { "Hello. I will teach you a magic word. To use it, just stand in front of me after [bold type]starting a new game[roman type] and [link]Import Progress[end link]. This will let you bend time and probability, returning you to the condition you were in when made the magic word... mostly. I will do my best, but my powers are not infinite. Also, I'm 'Out of Character', so you really don't see me. Confused yet? Good!" }.

Story Skipper ends here.
